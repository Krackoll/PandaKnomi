# Important Note

If you received a Panda Knomi with V1.0 or V1.1 firmware please update it to [V1.3.1](https://github.com/bigtreetech/PandaKnomi/tree/master/Firmware/v1.0.3.1) using the guide here: https://bttwiki.com/PandaKnomi.html#ota
If you set some parameters longer than a certain number of characters with the earlier firmware, before you perform the update, you may find that the panda knomi becomes unresponsive and needs to be reflashed over USB-C using the process here: https://bttwiki.com/PandaKnomi.html#flash_download_tool-type-c

# FAQs:

Will the Panda Knomi be affected by the new Bambu authorisation firmware?
- No. The Panda Knomi only reads status information from the printer which is considered as non-critical communication by Bambu and therefore does not require authentication.

Does the Panda Knomi have to add weight to the toolhead?
- No. There are several mounting options which allow you to locate it in visible places that do not move.

Is the Panda Knomi compatible with the P1 and X1 series?
- Yes. There are printable mounting options available for all machines in those series.
