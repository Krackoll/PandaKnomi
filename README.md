# FAQs:

Will the Panda Knomi be affected by the new Bambu authorisation firmware?
- No. The Panda Knomi only reads status information from the printer which is considered as non-critical communication by Bambu and therefore does not require authentication.

Does the Panda Knomi have to add weight to the toolhead?
- No. There are several mounting options which allow you to locate it in visible places that do not move.

Is the Panda Knomi compatible with the P1 and X1 series?
- Yes. There are printable mounting options available for all machines in those series.
